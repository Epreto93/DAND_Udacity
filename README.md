# DAND_Udacity
This repository contains projects I completed for [Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree course](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002) from 
the May 2018 corhort.

This course focused on analysing data to communicate insights, using python, R, SQL, and Tableau. 
I worked on python in Jupyter Notebook extensively in many of my projects and exercises, using 
libraries such as pandas, numpy, and matplotlib. I learnt and practiced data wrangling - gathering 
assessing and cleaning data. This helped me to refine my ability to work with messy, complex datasets 
and manipulate and prepare data for analysis. Some interesting things I learned during this process 
includes web scraping, API querying, and using regular expressions to extract information from free 
text into a more structured pandas dataframe. This course also included a statistics section 
covering, among other things, linear and logistic regression,  and A/B testing.
I learnt how to develop intuition about datasets via Exploratory Data Analyses, using R studio to
explore relationships and interactions between variables. Finally, I used Tableau to practice data 
story telling with explanatory interactive visualizations.
